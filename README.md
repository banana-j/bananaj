# Introduction

bananaj provides a Java wrapper for the MailChimp API 3.0. It is possible programmatically access most MailChimp features such as managing audiences, generate campaigns, and get report data.

# How to use

## Add to your project 
This is still in alpha. Some of the methods and models are subject to change in future builds. If you encounter some bugs or issues, please feel free to report them to the [Issues section](https://github.com/banana-j/bananaj/issues).

Add this dependency to your pom.xml to use **bananaj** in your project.
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.banana-j</groupId>
  <artifactId>bananaj</artifactId>
  <version>0.7.0</version>
</dependency>
```
or with Gradle

``` 
repositories {
    maven { url "http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2" }
}

dependencies {
    compile group: 'com.github.banana-j', name: 'bananaj', version: '0.7.0'
}
```

If you are not using Maven or Gradle you can download the latest `fat jar` from the [releases section](https://github.com/banana-j/bananaj/releases).

## Obtain an API key
Login to your Mailchimp account and access you account information. Navigate to API keys located under extras and create a key.

## Connect to Mailchimp
First establish a connection with the Mailchimp server.

```
MailChimpConnection con = new MailChimpConnection("yourAPIkey");

// Test connection
boolean ping = con.ping();
System.out.println("API Ping: " + (ping ? "succeed" : "failed"));
```

## Access your campaigns

```
// Print info for all campaigns with report and feedback
    System.out.println("Mailchimp Campaigns:");
    con.getCampaigns().forEach(campaign -> {
        System.out.println(campaign.toString());

        Report report = campaign.getReport();
        System.out.println(report.toString());

        List<CampaignFeedback> feedback = campaign.getFeedback().forEach(feedback -> {
            System.out.println(feedback.toString());
        });;
        
        System.out.println("");
    });
    System.out.println("");
```

## Access your audiences
```
// Print info for all audiences. Note that in the API an audience is called a list.
    System.out.println("Mailchimp audiences:");
    con.getLists().forEach(audiance -> {
        System.out.println(audiance.toString());
        System.out.println("");
    });
    System.out.println("");

// Get a single audience
    MailChimpList yourList = con.getList("ListID");

// Add a member to an audience

```

## Get Members
```
// Get all members from a specific mailChimpList
    yourList.getMembers().forEach(member -> {
        System.out.println(member.toString());
    });

// You can also get a specific member by specifying their email address or subscriber hash
    Member memberOfList = yourList.getMember("name@domain.com");
```

## Add/Update list subscriber
```
    Member member = new Member.Builder()
            .connection(con)
            .listId(yourList.getId())
            .emailAddress("name@domain.com")
            .emailType(EmailType.HTML)
            .status(MemberStatus.SUBSCRIBED)
            .mergeField("FNAME", "John")
            .mergeField("LNAME", "Smith")
            .language("en")
            .vip(false)
            .build();
    member.addOrUpdate();
```


## Create campaign
To create an email template simply specify a template name and the upload the pure html code to MailChimp
```
    CampaignRecipients mailRecipients = new CampaignRecipients.Builder()
        .listId(yourList.getId())
        .build();
    // -or- use new CampaignRecipients(Segment) to target by tag or interest group
    CampaignSettings settings = new CampaignSettings.Builder()
            .title("myTitle")
            .subjectLine("mySubject")
            .toName("*|FNAME|*")
            .fromName("myRobot")
            .replyTo("myEmail@my.domain.com")
            .templateId(12345)
            .folderId("12345")
            .build();
    Campaign campaign = con.createCampaign(CampaignType.REGULAR, myList, settings);
    // campaign.getContent().changeHTMLContent(htmlContent);  // if we don't use a template specify our own HTML content
    campaign.send();
    
    // TODO: show how to create campaign targeted to a tag segment.
```


## Upload a file to FileManager
MailChimp offers the opportunity to insert images and other files to your emails. To upload a file to MailChimp create a FileManager and specify the file you want to upload.
```
// Upload a file
    FileManagerFile myFile = con.getFileManager().upload("filename", myFile);
  
// Upload a file to a folder
    FileManagerFile myFile = con.getFileManager().upload("folder_id", "filename", myFile);
```

## Example programs
* [chimpexcel](https://github.com/gscriver/chimpexcel) A sample Java program to export Mailchimp audiences to file (XLS).
