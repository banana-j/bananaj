# Introduction

bananaj provides an Java wrapper for the MailChimp API 3.0. It is possible access your MailChimp data through Java. 

# How to use

## Add to your project 
This is still in alpha. If you encounter some bugs or issues, please feel free to report them to the [Issues section](https://github.com/alexanderwe/bananaj/issues).

Add this dependency to your pom.xml to use **bananaj** in your project.
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.alexanderwe</groupId>
  <artifactId>bananaj</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.4-alpha</version>
</dependency>
```

## MailChimpObject class
Most of the com.github.alexanderwe.bananaj.model classes extend the MailChimpObject class.They are immutable, to prevent asynchronous data between the client and the MailChimp server. 
When you execute methods like `object.changeName("new Name")` the local and server data is updated simultaneously.

Most of the com.github.alexanderwe.bananaj.model classes can also be exported to JSON.

## Initial com.github.alexanderwe.bananaj.connection
With the MailChimpConnection object you start to connect to your account. 
You can get all objects from this com.github.alexanderwe.bananaj.connection. First start with getting information about a list.

```
MailChimpConnection con = new MailChimpConnection("yourAPIkey");
```
## Get a list 
```
//Get all lists
List<MailChimpList> allLists = con.getLists();
```
```
//Get a single list
MailChimpList yourList = con.getList("ListID");
```

## Create a list

## Get Members
```
/*Get all members from a specific mailChimpList*/
 List<Member> membersOfList = yourList.getMembers(0,0); // Get all members, skip none
 List<Member> partOfMembers = yourList.getMembers(5,2); // Get first 5 members, but skip 2 members 
```
```
/*You can also get a specific member by specifying it's id*/
Member memberOfList = yourList.getMember("MemberID");
```


## Create template
To create an email template simply specify a template name and the upload the pure html code to MailChimp
```
con.addTemplate("templateName", "htmlCode");
```


## Create campaign
To create an email template simply specify a template name and the upload the pure html code to MailChimp
```
MailChimpList myList = con.getList("myListId");
CampaignSettings settings = new CampaignSettings.Builder()
		.title("myTitle")
		.subject_line("mySubject")
		.to_name("*|FNAME|*")
		.from_name("myRobot")
		.reply_to("myEmail@my.domain.com")
		.template_id(12345)
		.build();
Campaign campaign = con.createCampaign(CampaignType.REGULAR, myList, settings);
```


## Upload a file to FileManager
MailChimp offers the opportunity to insert images and other files to your emails. To upload a file to MailChimp create a FileManager and specify the file you want to upload.
```
FileManager fileManager = new FileManager(mailchimpconnection);

File myFile = new File("pathToYourFile");
  
//Upload a file
fileManager.upload("filename", myFile);
  
//Upload a file to a folder
fileManager.upload("folder_id","filename", myFile);
```

## Download a file
To download a file from the MailChimp File Manager you have to specifiy the file you want to download and the directory in which it should be saved after download. The file extension is set automatically.
```
fileManager.getFileManagerFile("fileID").downloadFile("./") //Download a file in the current directory
```

## Methods
Every endpoint supports GET, POST, and DELETE requests. So it is possible to fully control your MailChimp objects with this wrapper.
